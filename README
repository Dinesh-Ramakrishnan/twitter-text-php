= Twitter-text

A couple of PHP classes that provide auto=links and extraction of usernames,
lists, hashtags and URLs in a way consistant with the twitter-text-rb and
twitter-text-java projects by Matt Sanford

== Auto-Linking Example

require_once('Twitter/Autolink.php');

$autolinker = new Twitter_Autolink();
$html = $autolinker->autolink('Tweet mentioning @mikenz and refuring to his list @mikeNZ/sports and website http://mikenz.geek.nz');
echo $html;

== Extraction Example

require_once('Twitter/Extractor.php');

$extractor = new Twitter_Extractor();
$data = $extractor->extractAll('Tweet mentioning @mikenz and referring to his list @mikeNZ/sports and website http://mikenz.geek.nz');
var_dump($data);
